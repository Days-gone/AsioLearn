# C/S Demo
In this part, we intend to implement a simple client/server demo. The server will be a simple echo server, which will echo back the message sent by the client. The client will send a message to the server and print the message received from the server.
# Test
after you have built the project(now you have the client_l3 and server_l3), run the command follow:
```bash
cd build
# run the server in a terminal
./server_l3
# run the client in another terminal
./client_l3
```
